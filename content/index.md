title: Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Hello. My name is [Shane McDonald](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theshanemcd/). I
live in Jersey City NJ with my lovely wife Chao, along with our cat Milla and
our dog Rodger. I am currently employed by [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com) as
one of the lead engineers for [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible).

I created this website to serve as a place where I can capture my thoughts, and
to have a place where I can reflect on what I learn over the years. I spend a
lot of my free time trying to find the balance between embracing cutting edge
technology and living a simple life. Lately I have been trying avoid social
media and attempting to maximize the time I spend thinking my own thoughts.

I am a big fan of [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and
[Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/), and I very much believe that open source
software has made the world a better place, and I am proud to do my part in
continuing that mission.

If you would like to connect, my email is on my
[GitHub](https://github.com/shanemcd) profile.

Have a nice day ðŸŒž
